### Project Overview

### Part1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision
#### 1-1 Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
Explanation:
The de Casteljau's algorithm can calculate the points c(u), u∈[0,1] on the Bezier curve by a set of U values, we can calculate the coordinate sequence on the Bezier curve and draw the Bezier curve by it.

Implementation:

#### 1-2 Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

#### 1-3 Show screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original control points down to the final evaluated point.

![1-3-4](/pic/1-3-4.png)
#### 1-4 Show a screenshot of a slightly different Bezier curve by moving the original control points around and modifying the parameter t via mouse scrolling.

### Part2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau

### Part3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals

### Part4: Edge Flip
#### 4-1 Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
Explanation:

Implementation:

![4-1-2](/pic/4-1-2.png)
#### 4-2 Show screenshots of the teapot before and after some edge flips.
Before edge flips:

After edge flips:

#### 4-3 Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.

### Part5: Edge Split
#### 5-1 Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
Explanation:

Implementation:
![5-1-1](/pic/5-1-1.png)
![5-1-2](/pic/5-1-2.png)
#### 5-2 Show screenshots of a mesh before and after some edge splits.
Before edge splits:
![5-2-1](/pic/5-2-1.png)

After edge splits:
![5-2-2](/pic/5-2-2.png)



#### 5-3 Show screenshots of a mesh before and after a combination of both edge splits and edge flips.
Original:
![5-3-1](/pic/5-3-1.png)

After edge flip:
![5-3-2](/pic/5-3-2.png)

After the combination of both edge splits and edge flips:
![5-3-3](/pic/5-3-3.png)
#### 5-4 Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.

#### 5-5 If you have implemented support for boundary edges, show screenshots of your implementation properly handling split operations on boundary edges.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZJUHSY/cs284a_hw2_webpage/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
